        <ul>

            <li>She spent most of her life in the village of Haworth, which is also in West Yorksire.</li>
            <li>In 1842, Emily and her sister Charlotte went to live in Brussels while they attended school to improve their French and German.</li>
            <li>Emily was said to be shy and reserved.</li>
            <li>She has often been described as a lover of nature.</li>
            <li>Emily died from consumption (now known as tuberculosis) in 1848, meaning she never got to know of the success of her novel, Wuthering Heights.</li>
